  abstract = {Spray drift is a practical consequence of agricultural spraying operations. Because of the agronomical and environmental impacts of this phenomenon, drift has been widely studied and extensive information is available. Here we present a literature review on the relationships between global physical descriptors of agricultural sprays, air conditions and resulting drift, generally studied in wind tunnels. Basic physical factors are droplet size, droplet velocity, and the physicochemical characteristics of the sprayed product. When possible, data available in the literature are collated to draw trends. Contradictory information sometimes appears especially regarding droplet velocity and drift control. The main physical factors consist generally of medians such as Volume Median Diameter (VMD or Dv50) that do not always represent the heterogeneity of a spray and especially the spatial distribution of particle size and velocity. Technological parameters such as nozzle height, spray angle, travel speed are then related to initial physical factors and their contribution to driftability of sprays.},

  abstract = {With the release of dicamba-resistant crops, it is necessary to understand how technical and environmental conditions affect the application of dicamba. This study sought to evaluate drift from dicamba applications through flat-fan nozzles, under several wind speeds in a wind tunnel. Dicamba applications were performed through two standard (XR and TT) and two air induction (AIXR and TTI) 110015 nozzles at 0.9, 2.2, 3.6 and 4.9 ms−1 wind speeds. The applications were made at 276 kPa pressure and the dicamba rate was 561 g ae ha-1. The droplet spectrum was measured using a laser diffraction system. Artificial targets were used as drift collectors, positioned in a wind tunnel from 2 to 12 m downwind from the nozzles. Drift potential was determined using a fluorescent tracer added to solutions, quantified by fluorimetry. The air induction TTI nozzle produced the lowest percentage of dicamba drift at 2.2, 3.6 and 4.9 ms−1 wind speeds at all distances. Dicamba spray drift from XR, TT and AIXR nozzles increased exponentially as wind speed increased, whereas from TTI nozzle drift increased linearly as wind speed increased. Drift did not increase linearly as the volume percentage of droplets smaller than 100 µm and wind speed increased.},

Merr.] cultivars. The dicamba formulations used were diglycolamine (DGA), N,N-Bis-(3-aminopropyl)methylamine, and diglycolamine with VaporGrip (DGAvg). The wind tunnel drift study was conducted with these three dicamba formulations, two nozzle types (AIXR110015 and TTI110015), and five downwind distances from the nozzle (1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 m). The dicamba rate was 560 g ae ha−1, simulating a 140 L ha−1 carrier volume. The soybean exposure study was conducted in two experimental runs with three sublethal dicamba rates (0.112, 0.56, and 5.6 g ae ha−1), the three dicamba formulations aforementioned, and five non-DT soybean cultivars (Asgrow A3253, Asgrow AG2636, Credenz CZ2601LL, DynaGro 39RY25, and Hoegemeyer 2511NRR). Applications were made using a spray chamber with a single AI9502EVS even nozzle that delivered 140 L ha−1. During applications, soybean plants were at three-leaf growth stage. Dicamba formulations had different drift deposition across the AIXR and TTI nozzles. The soybean cultivars had different levels of sensitivity to dicamba and depended on rate vs. formulation interaction. The DGA caused greater biomass reduction on soybean cultivars compared with DGAvg, especially for Credenz CZ2601LL, which was one of the most dicamba-sensitive cultivars along with Hoegemeyer 2511NRR. Additional care must be taken to mitigate off-target movement from dicamba applications with these cultivars nearby.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate spray drift from a conventional field sprayer as influenced by meteorological and technical factors, and to provide spray operators with data on which to base sound judgements when applying pesticides. The study was conducted in grazing fields and cereal crops. RESULTS: Interpreting the results from 15 field trials under varying meteorological conditions using different boom heights and driving speeds indicates that, during normal spraying conditions, the most decisive factors influencing the total spray drift (TSD) will be boom height and wind speed, followed by air temperature, driving speed and vapour pressure deficit. One important finding was that TSD (within the encompassed range of meteorological conditions and a boom height of 0.4 m) could be expressed as a simple function of the fraction of droplets ≤ 100 µm. In cereal crops: TSD = 0.36 + 0.11× [fr. (d ≤ 100 µm)] and in grazing fields, TSD = 1.02 + 0.10× [fr. (d ≤ 100 µm)]. In most cases a fraction of the airborne drift passed over the 6 m sampling mast located 5 m downwind of the spray swath. CONCLUSIONS: Under specified conditions, the present results indicate a simple relation between the total spray drift and volume fractions of droplets ≤ 100 µm. Given the nozzle type, it was concluded that the most decisive factors determining TSD are wind speed and boom height. Evaluating the relative importance of the meteorological and technical factors contributes to increasing knowledge in this field of research. Copyright © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {The advent of biotechnology-derived, herbicide-resistant crops has revolutionized farming practices in many countries. Facile, highly effective, environmentally sound, and profitable weed control methods have been rapidly adopted by crop producers who value the benefits associated with biotechnology-derived weed management traits. But a rapid rise in the populations of several troublesome weeds that are tolerant or resistant to herbicides currently used in conjunction with herbicide-resistant crops may signify that the useful lifetime of these economically important weed management traits will be cut short. We describe the development of soybean and other broadleaf plant species resistant to dicamba, a widely used, inexpensive, and environmentally safe herbicide. The dicamba resistance technology will augment current herbicide resistance technologies and extend their effective lifetime. Attributes of both nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded dicamba resistance genes that affect the potency and expected durability of the herbicide resistance trait are examined. Soybean and other crops engineered to be resistant to dicamba, an environmentally friendly herbicide, will be useful as weeds become resistant to other herbicides.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pesticide applications using a specific droplet size and carrier volume could maximize herbicide efficacy while mitigating particle drift in a precise and efficient manner. The objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of spray droplet size and carrier volume on dicamba and glufosinate efficacy, and to determine the plausibility of droplet-size based site-specific weed management strategies. RESULTS Generally, across herbicides and carrier volumes, as droplet size increased, weed control decreased. Increased carrier volume (187 L ha−1) buffered this droplet size effect, thus greater droplet sizes could be used to mitigate drift potential while maintaining sufficient levels of weed control. To mitigate drift potential and achieve satisfactory weed control (≥ 90\% of maximum observed control), a 900 µm (Ultra Coarse) droplet size paired with 187 L ha−1 carrier volume is recommended for dicamba applications and a 605 µm (Extremely Coarse) droplet size across carrier volumes is recommended for glufosinate applications. Although general droplet size recommendations were created, optimum droplet sizes for weed control varied significantly across site-years. CONCLUSION Convoluted interactions occur between droplet size, carrier volume, and other application parameters. Recommendations for optimizing herbicide applications based on droplet size should be based on a site-specific management approach to better account for these interactions. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Pulse-width modulation (PWM) sprayers can improve application accuracy through flow control, turn compensation, and high-resolution overlap control by pulsing an electronically-actuated solenoid valve which controls the relative proportion of time each solenoid valve is open (duty cycle). The objective of this experiment was to identify the droplet size distribution and nozzle tip pressure when influenced by PWM duty cycle, nozzle technology, and gauge pressure to provide PWM guidelines. The experiment was conducted in a low-speed wind tunnel at the Pesticide Application Technology Laboratory using a SharpShooter® PWM system. In general, for non-venturi nozzles, as duty cycle decreased, droplet size slightly increased between 40 and 100\% duty cycles. Conversely, venturi nozzles did not always follow this trend. The lowest duty cycle evaluated (20\%) negatively impacted droplet size and caused inconsistencies for all nozzle by pressure combinations. The addition of a solenoid valve lowered nozzle tip pressure while gauge pressure remained constant indicating a restriction is present within the solenoid valve. Greater orifice sizes increased the pressure loss observed. Duty cycle minimally impacted nozzle tip pressure trends which were similar to the electrical square wave PWM signals. However, venturi nozzles deviated from this trend, specifically twin-fan, single pre-orifice venturi nozzles. In conclusion, venturi nozzles are not recommended for PWM systems as they may lead to inconsistent applications, specifically in regards to droplet size generation and nozzle tip pressures. Spray pressures of 276~kPa or greater and PWM duty cycles of 40\% or greater are recommended to ensure proper PWM operation.},

An online survey to assess ground and aerial herbicide application practices in Arkansas was made available online in spring 2019. The survey was direct-emailed to 272 agricultural aviators and 831 certified commercial pesticide applicators, as well as made publicly available online through multiple media sources. A total of 124 responses were received, of which 75 responses were specific to herbicide applications in Arkansas agronomic crops, accounting for approximately 49\% of Arkansas’ planted agronomic crop hectares in 2019. Ground and aerial application equipment were used for 49\% and 51\% of the herbicide applications on reported hectares, respectively. Rate controllers were commonly used application technologies for both ground and aerial application equipment. In contrast, global positioning system-driven automatic nozzle and boom shut-offs were much more common on ground spray equipment than aerial equipment. Applicator knowledge of nozzles and usage was limited, regardless of ground or aerial applicators, as only 28\% of respondents provided a specific nozzle type used, indicating a need for educational efforts on nozzles and their importance in herbicide applications. Of the reported nozzle types, venturi nozzles and straight-stream nozzles were the most commonly used for ground and aerial spray equipment, respectively. Spray carrier volumes of 96.3 and 118.8 L ha−1 for ground spray equipment and 49.6 and 59.9 L ha−1 for aerial application equipment were the means of reported spray volumes for systemic and contact herbicides, respectively. Respondents indicated application optimization was a major benefit of utilizing newer application technologies, herbicide drift was a primary challenge, and research needs expressed by respondents included adjuvants, spray volume efficacy, and herbicide drift. Findings from this survey provided insight into current practices, technologies, and needs of Arkansas herbicide applicators.

  abstract = {Recent concerns regarding herbicide spray drift, its subsequent effect on the surrounding environment, and herbicide efficacy have prompted applicators to focus on methods to reduce off-target movement of herbicides. Herbicide applications are complex processes, and as such, few studies have been conducted that consider multiple variables that affect the droplet spectrum of herbicide sprays. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of nozzle type, orifice size, herbicide active ingredient, pressure, and carrier volume on the droplet spectra of the herbicide spray. Droplet spectrum data were collected on 720 combinations of spray-application variables, which included six spray solutions (five herbicides and water alone), four carrier volumes, five nozzles, two orifice sizes, and three operating pressures. The laboratory study was conducted using a Sympatec laser diffraction instrument to determine the droplet spectrum characteristics of each treatment combination. When averaged over each main effect, nozzle type had the greatest effect on droplet size. Droplet size rankings for nozzles, ranked smallest to largest using volume median diameter (D                v0.5) values, were the XR, TT, AIXR, AI, and TTI nozzle with 176\% change in D                v0.5 values from the XR to the TTI nozzle. On average, increasing the nozzle orifice size from a 11003 orifice to a 11005 increased the D                v0.5 values 8\%. When compared with the water treatment, cloransulam (FirstRate) did not change the D                v0.5 value. Clethodim (Select Max), glyphosate (Roundup PowerMax), lactofen (Cobra), and glufosinate (Ignite) all reduced the D                v0.5 value 5, 11, 11, and 18\%, respectively, when compared with water averaged over the other variables. Increasing the pressure of AIXR, TT, TTI, and XR nozzles from 138 to 276 kPa and the AI nozzle from 276 to 414 kPa decreased the D                v0.5 value 25\%. Increasing the pressure from 276 to 414 kPa and from 414 to 552 kPa for the same nozzle group and AI nozzle decreased the D                v0.5 value 14\%. Carrier volume had the least effect on the D                v0.5 value. Increasing the carrier volume from 47 to 187 L ha−1 increased the D                v0.5 value 5\%, indicating that droplet size of the herbicides tested were not highly dependent on delivery volume. The effect on droplet size of the variables examined in this study from greatest effect to least effect were nozzle, operating pressure, herbicide, nozzle orifice size, and carrier volume.          ,              Recientemente ha habido preocupación por la deriva producto de la aplicación de herbicidas, su subsecuente efecto en el ambiente de los alrededores, y la eficacia del herbicida, lo que ha obligado a los aplicadores a enfocarse en métodos para reducir el movimiento de herbicidas a zonas fuera del objetivo deseado. Las aplicaciones de herbicidas son procesos complejos, y como tales, se han realizado pocos estudios que consideren múltiples variables que afectan el espectro de gotas producto de la aspersión del herbicida. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron elucidar los efectos del tipo de boquilla, el tamaño del orificio, el ingrediente activo del herbicida, la presión, y el volumen de aplicación sobre el espectro de gotas de la aspersión del herbicida. Los datos del espectro de gotas fueron colectados para 720 combinaciones de variables de aplicación-aspersión, las cuales incluyeron seis soluciones de aspersión (cinco herbicidas y agua sola), cuatro volúmenes de aplicación, cinco boquillas, dos tamaños de orificio, y tres presiones de operación. El estudio de laboratorio fue realizado usando un instrumento Sympactec de difracción láser para determinar las características del espectro de gotas para cada combinación de tratamientos. Al promediar los resultados por efecto principal, el tipo de boquilla tuvo el mayor efecto en el tamaño de gota. El ranking de tamaño de gota para boquillas, de más pequeña a más grande, usando valores de diámetro medio (D                v0.5), fue XR, TT, AIXR, AI, y TTI con 176\% de cambio en los valores de D                v0.5. En promedio, el incrementar el tamaño del orificio de la boquilla de un orificio 11003 a uno 11005 aumentó los valores D                v0.5 en 8\%. Cuando se comparó con el tratamiento con agua, cloransulam (FirstRate) no cambió el valor de D                v0.5. Clethodim (Select Max), glyphosate (Roundup PowerMax), lactofen (Cobra), y glufosinate (Ignite) redujeron los valores de D                v0.5 en 5, 11, 11, y 18\%, respectivamente, cuando se compararon con agua al promediarse sobre las otras variables. El incrementar la presión de las boquillas AIXR, TT, TTI, y XR de 138 a 276 kPa y la boquilla AI de 276 a 414 kPa disminuyó el valor de D                v0.5 en 25\%. El aumentar la presión de 276 a 414 kPa y de 414 a 552 kPa para el mismo grupo de boquillas y la boquilla AI disminuyó D                v0.5 en 14\%. El volumen de aplicación tuvo el menor efecto en el valor de D                v0.5. Al aumentar el volumen de aplicación de 47 a 187 L ha−1 se incrementó el valor de D                v0.5 en 5\%, indicando que el tamaño de gota de los herbicidas evaluados no fue altamente dependiente del volumen de aplicación. El efecto sobre el tamaño de gota de las variables examinadas en este estudio de mayor a menor efecto fue: boquilla, presión de operación, herbicida, tamaño del orificio de la boquilla, y el volumen de aplicación.},

  abstract = {Pesticides are commonly applied by using hydraulic nozzles to generate droplets. The properties of these spray droplets can influence the effectiveness and risks associated with the use of pesticides. Initial spray characteristics (initial droplet size and velocity, fan angle and spray liquid density) were therefore measured for a range of hydraulic nozzles and spray mixtures. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the spray sheet velocity. There was a significant difference between a standard hydraulic nozzle, Turbo TeeJet® and air induction nozzle for all measured spray characteristics. The standard hydraulic nozzle generated the smallest droplet sizes, the highest velocity and the highest spray liquid density. The air induction nozzle generated the largest droplet size, the slowest velocity and the lowest spray liquid density. The type of air induction nozzle and spray formulation was also found to influence spray characteristics. This work has demonstrated that initial spray characteristics such as droplet size and velocity, liquid density, fan angle and included air can vary depending on nozzle design, operating parameters and spray formulations. Initial droplet velocity was found to be significantly correlated to droplet size (Dv0.5) and spray pressure.},

  abstract = {Commercial introduction of cultivars of soybean and cotton genetically modified with resistance to the synthetic auxin herbicides dicamba and 2,4-D will allow these compounds to be used with greater flexibility but may expose susceptible soybean and cotton cultivars to nontarget herbicide drift. From past experience, it is well known that soybean and cotton are both highly sensitive to low-dose exposures of dicamba and 2,4-D. In this study, a meta-analysis approach was used to synthesize data from over seven decades of simulated drift experiments in which investigators treated soybean and cotton with low doses of dicamba and 2,4-D and measured the resulting yields. These data were used to produce global dose–response curves for each crop and herbicide, with crop yield plotted against herbicide dose. The meta-analysis showed that soybean is more susceptible to dicamba in the flowering stage and relatively tolerant to 2,4-D at all growth stages. Conversely, cotton is tolerant to dicamba but extremely sensitive to 2,4-D, especially in the vegetative and preflowering squaring stages. Both crops are highly variable in their responses to synthetic auxin herbicide exposure, with soil moisture and air temperature at the time of exposure identified as key factors. Visual injury symptoms, especially during vegetative stages, are not predictive of final yield loss. Global dose–response curves generated by this meta-analysis can inform guidelines for herbicide applications and provide producers and agricultural professionals with a benchmark of the mean and range of crop yield loss that can be expected from drift or other nontarget exposures to 2,4-D or dicamba.},

  abstract = {During application of agrochemicals spray droplets can drift beyond the intended target to non-target receptors, including water, plants and animals. Factors affecting this spray drift include mode of application, droplet size, which can be modified by the nozzle types, formulation adjuvants, wind direction, wind speed, air stability, relative humidity, temperature and height of released spray relative to the crop canopy. The rate of fall of spray droplets depends upon the size of the droplets but is modified by entrainment in a mobile air mass and is also influenced by the rate of evaporation of the liquid constituting the aerosol. The longer the aerosol remains in the air before falling to the ground (or alternatively striking an object above ground) the greater the opportunity for it to be carried away from its intended target. In general, all size classes of droplets are capable of movement off target, but the smallest are likely to move the farthest before depositing on the ground or a non-target receptor. It is not possible to avoid spray drift completely but it can be minimized by using best-management practices. These include using appropriate nozzle types, shields, spray pressure, volumes per area sprayed, tractor speed and only spraying when climatic conditions are suitable. Field layout can also influence spray drift, whilst crop-free and spray-free buffer zones and windbreak crops can also have a mitigating effect. Various models are available to estimate the environmental exposure from spray drift at the time of application.},

F and M spray qualities exhibited up to 86\% and 56\% less drift, respectively, out to 31 m downwind with the hooded sprayer than with the open sprayer. Conversely, VC and UC spray qualities were not affected by sprayer type out to 31 m downwind. From 43 to 104 m downwind, hooded sprayer applications exhibited approximately 50\% less drift than open sprayer applications, regardless of spray quality. From 43 to 89 m downwind, F spray qualities, regardless of sprayer type, exhibited higher drift than all other spray qualities. These data indicate that hooded sprayers considerably reduce drift of all spray qualities at short distances downwind. Additionally, at longer distances downwind, both larger spray qualities and sprayer hoods reduced drift independently.},

  abstract = {Glyphosate is the most widely used and successful herbicide discovered to date, but its utility is now threatened by the occurrence of several glyphosate-resistant weed species. Glyphosate resistance first appeared in Lolium rigidum in an apple orchard in Australia in 1996, ironically the year that the first glyphosate-resistant crop (soybean) was introduced in the USA. Thirty-eight weed species have now evolved resistance to glyphosate, distributed across 37 countries and in 34 different crops and six non-crop situations. Although glyphosate-resistant weeds have been identified in orchards, vineyards, plantations, cereals, fallow and non-crop situations, it is the glyphosate-resistant weeds in glyphosate-resistant crop systems that dominate the area infested and growing economic impact. Glyphosate-resistant weeds present the greatest threat to sustained weed control in major agronomic crops because this herbicide is used to control weeds with resistance to herbicides with other sites of action, and no new herbicide sites of action have been introduced for over 30 years. Industry has responded by developing herbicide resistance traits in major crops that allow existing herbicides to be used in a new way. However, over reliance on these traits will result in multiple-resistance in weeds. Weed control in major crops is at a precarious point, where we must maintain the utility of the herbicides we have until we can transition to new weed management technologies. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

An atomisation model has also been developed to predict droplet size for applications of tank mixes with user-defined or reasonable worst-case physical properties through a wide range of hydraulic nozzles applicable to aerial applications. The database and models help provide the exposure risk input to risk assessments for developing appropriate labelling based on exposure and toxicity risk to non-target sensitive areas. This needs to be balanced with allowing crop protection using careful risk/benefit assessments. Buffers or no spray zones may be based on spray quality, release height and other variables such as wind speed where necessary for protecting specific sensitive areas.

Experimental data investigating the effects of liquid physical properties such as dynamic surface tension, shear and extensional viscosity are described.

Although physicochemical properties of spray solutions are known to influence spray drift, they are not yet incorporated into regulatory risk assessments at the European level. In this review we give a systematic report on the relevant physical properties of agricultural spray liquids and how these influence spray characteristics. According to the data reported in literature, it can be concluded that not only spray-mix additives but also certain formulation types can be used to reduce spray drift. To complete the picture, existing drift mitigation techniques and conditions have been reviewed along with measuring equipment which is commonly used to characterize agricultural sprays and the droplet size-related biological aspects of the application process. In a final step, we discuss the possibility of estimating drift risk based on the physicochemical properties of spray liquids induced by different formulation types.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.}

  abstract = {Frequently, spray application of agrochemicals is effective but inefficient. A better understanding of the effects of spray application factors on spray performance may contribute to increased efficacy. In this paper the effects of droplet size and carrier volume on performance of foliage-applied herbicides are reviewed. Generally, performance increased as droplet size decreased at constant carrier volume, irrespective of the droplet size range investigated. Performance of systemic herbicides increased more consistently with decreasing droplet size, compared with herbicides with a contact mode of action. For monocotyledons with a predominantly vertical structure, decreasing droplet size in the size class {$<$}150 μm diameter enhanced performance more consistently than in the droplet size class {$>$}150 μm, or compared with dicotyledons with a predominantly horizontal structure. Further, decreasing droplet size more frequently enhanced herbicide performance on difficult-to-wet (contact angle of water droplets {$>$}110 degrees) than on easy-to-wet plants (contact angle {$<$}110 degrees). Carrier volume effects on herbicide performance were less consistent. At low volumes ({$<$}100 l ha−1), performance more frequently decreased as carrier volume decreased, whereas the reverse trend was observed at high carrier volumes ({$>$}400 l ha−1). A significant interaction between the effect of carrier volume and herbicide type was observed. For glyphosate, plant response consistently increased as carrier volume decreased, but for other herbicides performance generally decreased as carrier volume decreased. There was no difference in carrier volume effects between herbicides with a systemic or a contact mode of action, or between response of monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous species. However, on difficult-to-wet plants, decreasing carrier volume more frequently increased herbicide performance compared with easy-to-wet plants. The effects of the spray application factors droplet size and carrier volume on individual stages of the composite spray application process (i.e. canopy penetration and droplet impaction, retention, foliar uptake and the induction of a biological response) are discussed.},

Short, to-the-point chapters offer examples, exercises, and computer code (using WinBUGS or JAGS, and supported by Matlab and R), with additional support available online. No advance knowledge of statistics is required and, from the very start, readers are encouraged to apply and adjust Bayesian analyses by themselves. The book contains a series of chapters on parameter estimation and model selection, followed by detailed case studies from cognitive science. After working through this book, readers should be able to build their own Bayesian models, apply the models to their own data, and draw their own conclusions.},

  abstract = {The introduction of 2,4-D–resistant soybean will provide an additional POST herbicide site of action for control of herbicide-resistant broadleaf weeds. The introduction of this technology also brings concern of off-site movement of 2,4-D onto susceptible crops such as sensitive soybean and tomato. The 2,4-D formulation approved for use in 2,4-D–resistant soybean restricts application of the herbicide to nozzles that produce very coarse to ultra-coarse droplet spectrums. The use of larger droplet spectrums for broadcast applications can reduce herbicide deposition onto target weeds and thus influence herbicide efficacy. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of nozzle design on herbicide deposition onto target plants and the resulting efficacy of a POST application of 280 g ha−1 glyphosate plus 280 g ha−1 2,4-D. The TTI11004 nozzle produced an ultra-coarse droplet spectrum and reduced coverage and deposition density on spray cards as compared with the XR11004 and TT11004 nozzles that produced medium droplet spectrums. The AIXR11004 nozzle also reduced deposition density on spray cards but did not reduce coverage. Herbicide solution deposition onto glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth, tall waterhemp, giant ragweed, and horseweed ranged from 0.28 to 0.72 µl cm−2 and was not influenced by nozzle design. Herbicide efficacy was reduced by the TTI11004 nozzle on Palmer amaranth and horseweed compared with the AIXR11004, TT11004, and XR11004 nozzles when applications were made to either high densities of plants or plants exceeding the labeled height. The use of the AIXR11004 and TTI11004 nozzles that are listed as approved nozzles for glyphosate plus 2,4-D applications on 2,4-D–resistant soybean did not reduce herbicide deposition onto four of the most troublesome broadleaves and did not reduce herbicide efficacy when applied in conjunction with lower weed densities and smaller weeds.},

Disease progression was monitored twice a week on the two chosen Indian mustard cultivars viz., Varuna and Rohini throughout the season. Severity of blight caused by Alternaria brassicae and Alternaria brassicicola decreased with delay in sowing. Calculation for A-value (Area under disease progress curve – AUDPC) and r-value (apparent infection rate) in crops sown on different dates could identify the speed of progress in the disease on leaves and pods, as the crop does not posses resistance to the pathogen till date. Thus, the probable dates of sowing enabling slow disease progress or the weather conditions coinciding with the different crop phenological stages demarcated the advantageous dates of sowing from the disadvantageous ones. However, cultivar Varuna is more susceptible as compared to the other cultivar Rohini, as apparent infection rate both on leaves and pods was higher in former. Highest per cent disease severity (PDS) for season highly correlated with date of sowing, i.e. delayed date of sowing increased PDS.},

  abstract = {Summary: Résumé: Zusammenfassung Investigations of the effects of varying the boom height, working pressure, and wind speed on spray drift from a field sprayer are reported. By increasing the boom height from 40 to 80 cm drift increased from 1\% to 3–2\%; by increasing the pressure from 2–5 bar to 10 bar drift increased from 1–4\% to 2–9\%, and by increasing the wind velocity from approximately 1–5 m/s to approximately 4–0 m/s drift increased from 1–4\% to 2–9\%. A significant negative correlation was found between drift and the logarithm of the distance from the nozzle. A significant positive correlation was found between drift damage on barley plants and the logarithm of the spray-liquid deposit. Under ideal conditions, and with correctly adjusted spray equipment, total spray drift was 14\% of applied spray. Under unfavourable conditions, and with wrong adjustments of the sprayer (boom height and pressure) drift was 37\% of the applied spray. It is concluded that field spraying should not be carried out in wind speeds of more than 3 m/s. The boom should be approximately 40 cm high, and the working pressure should not exceed 2–5 bar for herbicide spraying.

L'élévation de ia rampe de 40 à 80 cm a accru I'entraînement de 1 à 3,2\%; I'augmentation de la pression, de 2.5 à 10 bars a accru I'entraînement de 1,4 h 2,9\% et I'augmentation de la Vitesse du vent de 1,5 à 4,0 màtres/sec a accru I'entraînement de 1,4 à 2,9\%. Une corrélation négative significative a été trouvée entre Tentraînement et le logarithme de la distance à partir de la buse. Une corrélation positive significative a été trouvée entre I'entraînement et le logarithme du dépét de la bouillie pulvérisée. Dans les conditions optimales et avec un pulvérisateur correctement réglé, I'entraînement total a été de 1,4\% du traitement appliqué. Dans des conditions défavorables et avec des régiages défectueux du pulvérisateur. (hauteur de la rampe et pression) I'entraînement a atteint 37\%. En conclusion, les traitements au champ par pulvérisation ne doivent pas être effectuées si la vitesse du vent dépasse 3 m/sec. La rampe doit être à 40 cm du sol environ et la pression de travail ne doit pas excéder 2,5 bars pour une pulvérisation effectuée avec un herbicide.

  abstract = {The effects of several spray-boom shield designs and ‘‘low-drift ’’ nozzles on spray drift are presented. Results are based on experiments conducted in a wind tunnel. Performances of all experimental shields were evaluated under two spray pressures (0·15 and 0·3MPa), and two air velocities (2·75 and 4·80m/s) in the wind tunnel. The distance to the centre of mass of the spray pattern from the nozzle (Dc) was used to characterize spray drift from different shield and nozzle combinations.Dcvalues resulting from different shields and nozzles were compared with theDcvalue from a standard flat-fan nozzle with no shield. A smallerDcvalue is desirable because it indicates that more spray is deposited near the nozzle and there is less material available for drift. All nine shields tested during this study effectively reducedDc. Even the least effective shield design produced a 13\% reduction in theDcvalue. A double-foil shield produced the best spray-deposit result with a reduction of 59\% inDccompared with the same nozzles spraying without the shield. The shields were effective even when used with nozzles with higher flow rates (pro-ducing a smaller percentage of spray volume in small droplets). However, the use of larger capacity nozzles reduced drift more than smaller capacity nozzles with even the most effective shield. Low-drift (LD) nozzles without a shield provided reductions inDcranging from 20 percent to 67 percent when compared with theDcfrom a 0·61l /min standard flat-fan (SFF) nozzle operating under identical conditions. The reduction inDcwith the 0·61l /min SFF nozzles operating with shield 2 (the best shield) was twice as high (59\% versus 27\%) as that from same capacity LD nozzles operating without a shield. However, the reduction inDcfrom low-capacity LD nozzles without a shield was twice that of the SFF nozzles of the same capacity operating with shield 5/1 (the shield with the worst performance). Without a shield, LD nozzles at higher flow rates are no more advantageous in reducing drift than SFF nozzles of similar flow rate.},

  abstract = {Studies of mechanisms of resistance to glyphosate have increased current understanding of herbicide resistance mechanisms. Thus far, single-codon non-synonymous mutations of EPSPS (5-enolypyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) have been rare and, relative to other herbicide mode of action target-site mutations, unconventionally weak in magnitude for resistance to glyphosate. However, it is possible that weeds will emerge with non-synonymous mutations of two codons of EPSPS to produce an enzyme endowing greater resistance to glyphosate. Today, target-gene duplication is a common glyphosate resistance mechanism and could become a fundamental process for developing any resistance trait. Based on competition and substrate selectivity studies in several species, rapid vacuole sequestration of glyphosate occurs via a transporter mechanism. Conversely, as the chloroplast requires transporters for uptake of important metabolites, transporters associated with the two plastid membranes may separately, or together, successfully block glyphosate delivery. A model based on finite glyphosate dose and limiting time required for chloroplast loading sets the stage for understanding how uniquely different mechanisms can contribute to overall glyphosate resistance. © 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {The adoption of auxin-tolerant crops has increased awareness regarding herbicide off-target movement. Deposition aids are promoted as a possible solution to off-target movement, although their effect on spray canopy deposition are not well understood. Studies were conducted to determine the impact of deposition aids tank-mixed with herbicides on spray droplet size and canopy deposition. Commonly used herbicides were applied on soybean and cotton in combination with deposition aids (oil, polymer, and guargum). Interactions between herbicide solution and deposition aid influenced droplet size parameters for both cotton and soybean herbicides tested herein (p ≤ 0.0001). Generally, the addition of polymer and guargum deposition aids increased spray droplet size, whereas the addition of oil deposition aid decreased droplet size for some treatments. When herbicides were combined, the inclusion of deposition aids did not influence overall spray deposition on cotton (p = 0.82) and soybean (p = 0.72). When herbicide solutions were evaluated individually, the advent of deposition aids had inconsistent results with cotton and soybean spray deposition being unaffected, increased, or even decreased depending on the herbicide solution tested. For example, the polymer-based deposition aid increased spray deposition on cotton for applications of glyphosate + dicamba + S-metolachlor resulting in 1640.6 RFU (relative fluorescence units). However, the same deposition aid decreased spray deposition on cotton for applications of glyphosate + dicamba + acetochlor (1179.3 RFU). Although deposition aids influenced spray deposition on cotton and soybean for some herbicide combinations, their use should be determined on a case-by-case scenario.},

However, our analysis shows that this approach severely underestimates the effect of the first and last observation. To get a better estimate of disease progress, we have developed a new formula termed the area under the disease progress stairs (AUDPS). The AUDPS approach improves the estimation of disease progress by giving a weight closer to optimal to the first and last observations. Analysis of real data indicates that AUDPS outperforms AUDPC in most of the tested trials and may be less precise than AUDPC only when assessments in the first or last observations have a comparatively large variance. We propose using AUDPS and its standardized (sAUDPS) and relative (rAUDPS) forms when combining multiple observations from disease progress experiments into a single value.},

  abstract = {Six experiments were conducted in 2018 on field sites located in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Ontario, and Wisconsin to evaluate the off-target movement (OTM) of dicamba under field-scale conditions. The highest estimated percentages of dicamba injury in non–dicamba-resistant (DR) soybean were 55\%, 44\%, 39\%, 67\%, 15\%, and 44\% injury for noncovered areas and 55\%, 5\%, 13\%, 42\%, 0\%, and 41\% injury for covered areas during dicamba application in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Ontario, and Wisconsin, respectively. The level of injury generally decreased as the downwind distance increased under covered and noncovered areas at all sites. There was an estimated 10\% injury in non-DR soybean at 113, 8, 11, 8, and 8 m; and estimated 1\% injury at 293, 28, 71, 15, and 19 m from the edge of treated fields downwind when plants were not covered during dicamba application in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ontario, and Wisconsin, respectively. Assessment of filter-paper collectors placed from 4 to 137 m downwind from the edge of the sprayed area suggested the dicamba deposition reduced exponentially with distance. The greatest injury to non-DR soybean from dicamba OTM occurred at Nebraska and Arkansas (as far as 250 m). Non-DR soybean injury was greatest adjacent to the dicamba sprayed area, but injury decreased with no injury beyond 20 m downwind or in any other direction from the dicamba sprayed area in Indiana, Michigan, Ontario, and Wisconsin. The presence of soybean injury under covered and noncovered areas during the spray period for primary drift suggests that secondary movement of dicamba was evident at five sites. Additional research is needed to determine the exact forms of secondary movement of dicamba under different environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Use of synthetic auxin herbicides has increased across the midwestern United States after adoption of synthetic auxin-resistant soybean traits, in addition to extensive use of these herbicides in corn. Off-target movement of synthetic auxin herbicides such as dicamba can lead to severe injury to sensitive plants nearby. Previous research has documented effects of glyphosate on spray-solution pH and volatility of several dicamba formulations, but our understanding of the relationships between glyphosate and dicamba formulations commonly used in corn and for 2,4-D remains limited. The objectives of this research were to (1) investigate the roles of synthetic auxin herbicide formulation, glyphosate, and spray additives on spray solution pH; (2) assess the impact of synthetic auxin herbicide rate on solution pH; and (3) assess the influence of glyphosate and application time of year on dicamba and 2,4-D volatility using soybean as bioindicators in low-tunnel field volatility experiments. Addition of glyphosate to a synthetic auxin herbicide decreased solution pH below 5.0 for four of the seven herbicides tested (range of initial pH of water source, 7.45–7.70). Solution pH of most treatments was lower at a higher application rate (4× the labeled POST rate) than the 1× rate. Among all treatment factors, inclusion of glyphosate was the most important affecting spray solution pH; however, the addition of glyphosate did not influence area under the injury over distance stairs (P = 0.366) in low-tunnel field volatility experiments. Greater soybean injury in field experiments was associated with high air temperatures (maximum, {$>$}29 C) and low wind speeds (mean, 0.3–1.5 m s−1) during the 48 h after treatment application. The two dicamba formulations (diglycolamine with VaporGrip® and sodium salts) resulted in similar levels of soybean injury for applications that occurred later in the growing season. Greater soybean injury was observed after dicamba than after 2,4-D treatments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Herbicide particle drift reduces application efficacy and can cause severe impacts on nearby vegetation depending on the herbicide mode of action, exposure level, and tolerance to the herbicide. A particle drift mitigation effort placing windbreaks or barriers on the field boundaries to reduce off-target movement of spray particles has been utilized in the past. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of field corn (Zea mays L.) at different heights as a particle drift barrier. RESULTS Applications with a non-air inclusion flat fan nozzle (ER11004) resulted in greater particle drift when compared with an air inclusion nozzle (TTI11004). Eight rows of corn were used as barriers (0.91, 1.22, and 1.98 m height) which reduced the particle drift for both nozzles, especially at shorter downwind distances. Applications with the ER11004 nozzle without corn barriers had 1\% of the applied rate (D99) predicted to deposit at 14.8 m downwind, whereas this distance was reduced (up to 7-fold) when applications were performed with corn barriers. The combination of corn drift barriers and nozzle selection (TTI11004) provided satisfactory particle drift reduction when the D99 estimates were compared with those for applications with the ER11004 nozzle without corn barriers (up to 10-fold difference). CONCLUSION The corn drift barriers were effective in reducing particle drift from applications with the ER11004 and the TTI11004 nozzles (Fine and Ultra Coarse spray classifications, respectively). The corn drift barrier had appropriate porosity and width as the airborne spray was captured within its canopy instead of deflecting up and over it. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {In 2017, dicamba-resistant (DR) soybean was commercially available to farmers in the United States. In August and September of 2017, a survey of 312 farmers from 60 Nebraska soybeanproducing counties was conducted during extension field days or online. The objective of this survey was to understand farmers’ adoption and perceptions regarding DR soybean technology in Nebraska. The survey contained 16 questions and was divided in three parts: (1) demographics, (2) dicamba application in DR soybean, and (3) dicamba off-target injury to sensitive soybean cultivars. According to the results, 20\% of soybean hectares represented by the survey were planted to DR soybean in 2017, and this number would probably double in 2018. Sixty-five percent of survey respondents own a sprayer and apply their own herbicide programs. More than 90\% of respondents who adopted DR soybean technology reported significant improvement in weed control. Nearly 60\% of respondents used dicamba alone or glyphosate plus dicamba for POST weed control in DR soybean; the remaining 40\% added an additional herbicide with an alternative site of action (SOA) to the POST application. All survey respondents used one of the approved dicamba formulations for application in DR soybean. Survey results indicated that late POST dicamba applications (after late June) were more likely to result in injury to non-DR soybean compared to early POST applications (e.g., May and early June) in 2017. According to respondents, off-target dicamba movement resulted both from applications in DR soybean and dicamba-based herbicides applied in corn. Although 51\% of respondents noted dicamba injury on non-DR soybean, 7\% of those who noted injury filed an official complaint with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Although DR soybean technology allowed farmers to achieve better weed control during 2017 than previous growing seasons, it is apparent that off-target movement and resistance management must be addressed to maintain the viability and effectiveness of the technology in the future.},

  abstract = {Enlist E3TM soybean cultivars permit over-the-top application of labeled glyphosate, glufosinate and 2,4-D choline products. Increased Enlist E3TM trait adoption and use of 2,4-D choline POST across US soybean production systems raise concerns regarding potential for 2,4-D off-target movement (OTM). A large-scale drift experiment was established near Sun Prairie, WI and Arlington, WI in 2019 and 2020, respectively. A 2,4-D-resistant soybean cultivar was planted in the center of the field (˜3 ha), while the surrounding area was planted with a 2,4-D-susceptible cultivar. An application of 785 ae ha−1 2,4-D choline plus 834 g ae ha−1 glyphosate was completed within the center block at R2 and V6 growth stage on Aug 1, 2019 and Jul 3, 2020, respectively. Filter papers were placed in-swath and outside of the treated area in one upwind transect and three downwind transects to estimate particle deposition. Low volume air samplers ran for the 0.5 to 48 h period following application to estimate 2,4-D air concentration. Injury to 2,4-D-susceptible soybean was assessed 21 d after treatment (0 to 100\% injury). The 2,4-D deposition in-swath was 9,966 and 5727 ƞg cm−2 in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Three-parameter log-logistic models estimated the distance to 90\% reduction in 2,4-D deposition (D90) was 0.63 and 0.90 m in 2019 and 2020, respectively. In 2020, the 2,4-D air concentration detected was lower for the upwind (0.395 ƞg cm−3) than the downwind direction (1.34 ƞg cm−3), although both were lower than the amount detected in-swath (4.01 ƞg cm−3). No soybean injury was observed in the downwind or upwind directions. Our results suggest that 2,4-D choline applications following label recommendations pose little risk to 2,4-D-susceptible soybean cultivars; however, further work is needed to understand 2,4-D choline OTM under different environmental conditions and the presence of other susceptible crops.},
