  abstract = {Spray drift is a practical consequence of agricultural spraying operations. Because of the agronomical and environmental impacts of this phenomenon, drift has been widely studied and extensive information is available. Here we present a literature review on the relationships between global physical descriptors of agricultural sprays, air conditions and resulting drift, generally studied in wind tunnels. Basic physical factors are droplet size, droplet velocity, and the physicochemical characteristics of the sprayed product. When possible, data available in the literature are collated to draw trends. Contradictory information sometimes appears especially regarding droplet velocity and drift control. The main physical factors consist generally of medians such as Volume Median Diameter (VMD or Dv50) that do not always represent the heterogeneity of a spray and especially the spatial distribution of particle size and velocity. Technological parameters such as nozzle height, spray angle, travel speed are then related to initial physical factors and their contribution to driftability of sprays.},

  abstract = {The advent of biotechnology-derived, herbicide-resistant crops has revolutionized farming practices in many countries. Facile, highly effective, environmentally sound, and profitable weed control methods have been rapidly adopted by crop producers who value the benefits associated with biotechnology-derived weed management traits. But a rapid rise in the populations of several troublesome weeds that are tolerant or resistant to herbicides currently used in conjunction with herbicide-resistant crops may signify that the useful lifetime of these economically important weed management traits will be cut short. We describe the development of soybean and other broadleaf plant species resistant to dicamba, a widely used, inexpensive, and environmentally safe herbicide. The dicamba resistance technology will augment current herbicide resistance technologies and extend their effective lifetime. Attributes of both nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded dicamba resistance genes that affect the potency and expected durability of the herbicide resistance trait are examined. Soybean and other crops engineered to be resistant to dicamba, an environmentally friendly herbicide, will be useful as weeds become resistant to other herbicides. Soybean and other crops engineered to be resistant to dicamba, an environmentally friendly herbicide, will be useful as weeds become resistant to other herbicides.},

  abstract = {Glyphosate is the most widely used and successful herbicide discovered to date, but its utility is now threatened by the occurrence of several glyphosate-resistant weed species. Glyphosate resistance first appeared in Lolium rigidum in an apple orchard in Australia in 1996, ironically the year that the first glyphosate-resistant crop (soybean) was introduced in the USA. Thirty-eight weed species have now evolved resistance to glyphosate, distributed across 37 countries and in 34 different crops and six non-crop situations. Although glyphosate-resistant weeds have been identified in orchards, vineyards, plantations, cereals, fallow and non-crop situations, it is the glyphosate-resistant weeds in glyphosate-resistant crop systems that dominate the area infested and growing economic impact. Glyphosate-resistant weeds present the greatest threat to sustained weed control in major agronomic crops because this herbicide is used to control weeds with resistance to herbicides with other sites of action, and no new herbicide sites of action have been introduced for over 30 years. Industry has responded by developing herbicide resistance traits in major crops that allow existing herbicides to be used in a new way. However, over reliance on these traits will result in multiple-resistance in weeds. Weed control in major crops is at a precarious point, where we must maintain the utility of the herbicides we have until we can transition to new weed management technologies. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.}

Disease progression was monitored twice a week on the two chosen Indian mustard cultivars viz., Varuna and Rohini throughout the season. Severity of blight caused by Alternaria brassicae and Alternaria brassicicola decreased with delay in sowing. Calculation for A-value (Area under disease progress curve – AUDPC) and r-value (apparent infection rate) in crops sown on different dates could identify the speed of progress in the disease on leaves and pods, as the crop does not posses resistance to the pathogen till date. Thus, the probable dates of sowing enabling slow disease progress or the weather conditions coinciding with the different crop phenological stages demarcated the advantageous dates of sowing from the disadvantageous ones. However, cultivar Varuna is more susceptible as compared to the other cultivar Rohini, as apparent infection rate both on leaves and pods was higher in former. Highest per cent disease severity (PDS) for season highly correlated with date of sowing, i.e. delayed date of sowing increased PDS.},

  abstract = {Studies of mechanisms of resistance to glyphosate have increased current understanding of herbicide resistance mechanisms. Thus far, single-codon non-synonymous mutations of EPSPS (5-enolypyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) have been rare and, relative to other herbicide mode of action target-site mutations, unconventionally weak in magnitude for resistance to glyphosate. However, it is possible that weeds will emerge with non-synonymous mutations of two codons of EPSPS to produce an enzyme endowing greater resistance to glyphosate. Today, target-gene duplication is a common glyphosate resistance mechanism and could become a fundamental process for developing any resistance trait. Based on competition and substrate selectivity studies in several species, rapid vacuole sequestration of glyphosate occurs via a transporter mechanism. Conversely, as the chloroplast requires transporters for uptake of important metabolites, transporters associated with the two plastid membranes may separately, or together, successfully block glyphosate delivery. A model based on finite glyphosate dose and limiting time required for chloroplast loading sets the stage for understanding how uniquely different mechanisms can contribute to overall glyphosate resistance. © 2014 The Authors.

However, our analysis shows that this approach severely underestimates the effect of the first and last observation. To get a better estimate of disease progress, we have developed a new formula termed the area under the disease progress stairs (AUDPS). The AUDPS approach improves the estimation of disease progress by giving a weight closer to optimal to the first and last observations. Analysis of real data indicates that AUDPS outperforms AUDPC in most of the tested trials and may be less precise than AUDPC only when assessments in the first or last observations have a comparatively large variance. We propose using AUDPS and its standardized (sAUDPS) and relative (rAUDPS) forms when combining multiple observations from disease progress experiments into a single value.},

The highest estimated percentages of dicamba injury in non–dicamba-resistant (DR) soybean were 55\%, 44\%, 39\%, 67\%, 15\%, and 44\% injury for noncovered areas and 55\%, 5\%, 13\%, 42\%, 0\%, and 41\% injury for covered areas during dicamba application in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Ontario, and Wisconsin, respectively. The level of injury generally decreased as the downwind distance increased under covered and noncovered areas at all sites. There was an estimated 10\% injury in non-DR soybean at 113, 8, 11, 8, and 8 m; and estimated 1\% injury at 293, 28, 71, 15, and 19 m from the edge of treated fields downwind when plants were not covered during dicamba application in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ontario, and Wisconsin, respectively. Assessment of filter-paper collectors placed from 4 to 137 m downwind from the edge of the sprayed area suggested the dicamba deposition reduced exponentially with distance. The greatest injury to non-DR soybean from dicamba OTM occurred at Nebraska and Arkansas (as far as 250 m). Non-DR soybean injury was greatest adjacent to the dicamba sprayed area, but injury decreased with no injury beyond 20 m downwind or in any other direction from the dicamba sprayed area in Indiana, Michigan, Ontario, and Wisconsin. The presence of soybean injury under covered and noncovered areas during the spray period for primary drift suggests that secondary movement of dicamba was evident at five sites. Additional research is needed to determine the exact forms of secondary movement of dicamba under different environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Use of synthetic auxin herbicides has increased across the midwestern United States after adoption of synthetic auxin-resistant soybean traits, in addition to extensive use of these herbicides in corn. Off-target movement of synthetic auxin herbicides such as dicamba can lead to severe injury to sensitive plants nearby. Previous research has documented effects of glyphosate on spray-solution pH and volatility of several dicamba formulations, but our understanding of the relationships between glyphosate and dicamba formulations commonly used in corn and for 2,4-D remains limited. The objectives of this research were to (1) investigate the roles of synthetic auxin herbicide formulation, glyphosate, and spray additives on spray solution pH; (2) assess the impact of synthetic auxin herbicide rate on solution pH; and (3) assess the influence of glyphosate and application time of year on dicamba and 2,4-D volatility using soybean as bioindicators in low-tunnel field volatility experiments. Addition of glyphosate to a synthetic auxin herbicide decreased solution pH below 5.0 for four of the seven herbicides tested (range of initial pH of water source, 7.45–7.70). Solution pH of most treatments was lower at a higher application rate (4× the labeled POST rate) than the 1× rate. Among all treatment factors, inclusion of glyphosate was the most important affecting spray solution pH; however, the addition of glyphosate did not influence area under the injury over distance stairs (P = 0.366) in low-tunnel field volatility experiments. Greater soybean injury in field experiments was associated with high air temperatures (maximum, {$>$}29 C) and low wind speeds (mean, 0.3–1.5 m s−1) during the 48 h after treatment application. The two dicamba formulations (diglycolamine with VaporGrip® and sodium salts) resulted in similar levels of soybean injury for applications that occurred later in the growing season. Greater soybean injury was observed after dicamba than after 2,4-D treatments.},

In August and September of 2017, a survey of 312 farmers from 60 Nebraska soybeanproducing counties was conducted during extension field days or online. The objective of this survey was to understand farmers’ adoption and perceptions regarding DR soybean technology in Nebraska. The survey contained 16 questions and was divided in three parts: (1) demographics, (2) dicamba application in DR soybean, and (3) dicamba off-target injury to sensitive soybean cultivars. According to the results, 20\% of soybean hectares represented by the survey were planted to DR soybean in 2017, and this number would probably double in 2018. Sixty-five percent of survey respondents own a sprayer and apply their own herbicide programs. More than 90\% of respondents who adopted DR soybean technology reported significant improvement in weed control. Nearly 60\% of respondents used dicamba alone or glyphosate plus dicamba for POST weed control in DR soybean; the remaining 40\% added an additional herbicide with an alternative site of action (SOA) to the POST application. All survey respondents used one of the approved dicamba formulations for application in DR soybean. Survey results indicated that late POST dicamba applications (after late June) were more likely to result in injury to non-DR soybean compared to early POST applications (e.g., May and early June) in 2017. According to respondents, off-target dicamba movement resulted both from applications in DR soybean and dicamba-based herbicides applied in corn. Although 51\% of respondents noted dicamba injury on non-DR soybean, 7\% of those who noted injury filed an official complaint with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Although DR soybean technology allowed farmers to achieve better weed control during 2017 than previous growing seasons, it is apparent that off-target movement and resistance management must be addressed to maintain the viability and effectiveness of the technology in the future.},

  abstract = {Enlist E3TM soybean cultivars permit over-the-top application of labeled glyphosate, glufosinate and 2,4-D choline products. Increased Enlist E3TM trait adoption and use of 2,4-D choline POST across US soybean production systems raise concerns regarding potential for 2,4-D off-target movement (OTM). A large-scale drift experiment was established near Sun Prairie, WI and Arlington, WI in 2019 and 2020, respectively. A 2,4-D-resistant soybean cultivar was planted in the center of the field (˜3 ha), while the surrounding area was planted with a 2,4-D-susceptible cultivar. An application of 785 ae ha−1 2,4-D choline plus 834 g ae ha−1 glyphosate was completed within the center block at R2 and V6 growth stage on Aug 1, 2019 and Jul 3, 2020, respectively. Filter papers were placed in-swath and outside of the treated area in one upwind transect and three downwind transects to estimate particle deposition. Low volume air samplers ran for the 0.5 to 48 h period following application to estimate 2,4-D air concentration. Injury to 2,4-D-susceptible soybean was assessed 21 d after treatment (0 to 100\% injury). The 2,4-D deposition in-swath was 9,966 and 5727 ƞg cm−2 in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Three-parameter log-logistic models estimated the distance to 90\% reduction in 2,4-D deposition (D90) was 0.63 and 0.90 m in 2019 and 2020, respectively. In 2020, the 2,4-D air concentration detected was lower for the upwind (0.395 ƞg cm−3) than the downwind direction (1.34 ƞg cm−3), although both were lower than the amount detected in-swath (4.01 ƞg cm−3). No soybean injury was observed in the downwind or upwind directions. Our results suggest that 2,4-D choline applications following label recommendations pose little risk to 2,4-D-susceptible soybean cultivars; however, further work is needed to understand 2,4-D choline OTM under different environmental conditions and the presence of other susceptible crops.},
